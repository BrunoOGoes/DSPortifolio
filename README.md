# Data science  portifolio
## Bruno Ortega Goes, Ms

Welcome! I would like to present some of my data science projects that I am particularly proud of. These projects were completed as part of my learning and exploration journey in the field of data science. They showcase my personal interests and demonstrate my skills in modeling, data treatment, and interpretation. Throughout my training, I have gained experience with various tools and techniques, which I have applied to these projects presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

Please note that this repository is currently a work in progress. As soon as new projects are ready, they will be posted here.

# About Me

I am a scientist, specifically trained as a theoretical physicist with a strong emphasis on quantum technologies and quantum thermodynamics. My professional profile is multidisciplinary, and I possess a profound admiration for mathematical models and their capacity to unveil patterns within data, enabling us to delve into the realms of the physical world, society, and beyond. Following the completion of my PhD in nanophysics, my ambitions have shifted towards pursuing a career in Data Science. My objective is to leverage my advanced mathematical and programming skills to develop models that have the potential to propel business success, offer invaluable insights, and deliver effective data-driven solutions.
